Why We need to use Automapper -

Why use AutoMapper?
Mapping code is boring. Testing mapping code is even more boring. AutoMapper provides 
simple configuration of types, as well as simple testing of mappings. The real question may
be “why use object-object mapping?” Mapping can occur in many places in an application,
but mostly in the boundaries between layers, such as between the UI/Domain layers, or 
Service/Domain layers. Concerns of one layer often conflict with concerns in another, 
so object-object mapping leads to segregated models, where concerns for each layer can 
affect only types in that layer.
